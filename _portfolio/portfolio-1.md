Modeling fracture in geomaterials having distinct strength and stiffness is complex due to their unique occurrence of crack branching, coalescence, and interaction patterns. Fractures in such materials are often initiated by contact-induced loading conditions, including joint slip, fault activation, and penetration. Accurately capturing the interplay between contact and fracture mechanics remains a challenge for computational modeling of rocks. This study addresses this fundamental duality by proposing a coupled Peridynamics–Discrete Element Method (PD-DEM) framework with realistic damage and contact models. Below pictures show the continous crushing process in rock ballast simulated by the PD-DEM framework.
